# Debug Status: my-static-website

## Starting Status (Baseline)
- Commit: `2f91ac7`
- Files present:
  - `index.html`
  - `css/style.css` (empty)
  - `js/script.js` (not referenced in HTML)
  - `README.md`
- Observations:
  - `index.html` renders a single-page portfolio with inline styles.
  - No reference to `js/script.js`, so the script never loads.
  - No GitHub Pages configuration files present.
  - If GitHub Pages source is set to `docs/`, the site would 404 because no `docs/` folder exists.

## Changes Made
- Added a small deployment safeguard: `.nojekyll` at the publish root(s) to prevent unintended Jekyll processing.
- Linked the JavaScript file from `index.html` so it actually loads in production.
- Created a `docs/` directory mirroring the site (HTML, CSS, JS, `.nojekyll`) so GitHub Pages works whether the source is set to `root` or `docs/`.

## Ending Status
- Project can be served from either:
  - GitHub Pages → Source: `main` → Folder: `/ (root)`; or
  - GitHub Pages → Source: `main` → Folder: `docs/`.
- `index.html` now includes `<script src="js/script.js" defer></script>` so the console log appears and future scripts run.
- No functional changes to layout or content.

## Next Steps (if desired)
- Pick one Pages source in repository Settings → Pages (prefer `main` + `/(root)` to avoid duplication). If you choose root, you can delete the `docs/` folder later.
- Optionally move the inline `<style>` rules into `css/style.css` for cleaner separation.
- If you want automatic deployments to GitHub Pages via Actions, I can add a workflow.
